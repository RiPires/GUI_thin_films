Welcome to ARC-TF!

Workflow

The program supports four different types of tabs, each with a distinct purpose. The Final Results Tab is a special tab that consolidates and displays all results generated within the Calibration Analysis and Material Analysis tabs. This tab cannot be created or deleted manually by the user, as it is automatically maintained by the program. Its primary function is to provide an overview of the outcomes produced in the other analysis tabs.
The Calibration Analysis Tabs are dedicated to performing calibration-related computations. Users are free to create and delete these tabs depending on their needs. Each calibration tab offers a set of options and tools specific to calibration workflows.
Similarly, the Material Analysis Tabs are designed for performing analyses on different film materials. As with the calibration tabs, users can freely create or delete these tabs as required. The options available within a material analysis tab differ from those found in calibration tabs.
The final type, the XRA Analysis Tab, is a recently added feature. Unlike the other three tab types, the XRA Analysis Tab is fully independent and does not interact with the Final Results Tab, Calibration Analysis Tabs, or Material Analysis Tabs. It provides its own dedicated functionality for XRA-specific analysis.


Calibration Tab:

The program automatically starts with one calibration tab open. However, the user has the option to open 
more calibration tabs. Here, the user can click the File button on the menu bar, and click the first option 
to upload the experimental data that is saved in the computer. ARC-TF will automatically plot this data and 
show it embedded in the GUI. From here, the user can detect the peaks, selecting the analysis algorithm 
first, up to a maximum of 15 values. The corresponding channels and counts will appear on screen at the top 
right corner. The user can reset all these values, or uncheck a selection of them. If unchecked, the user 
needs to clear these values. Following this analysis, the user can select the radiation source. Once again, 
the user has the possibility to check/uncheck the energy values that the interface will use for the both the 
linear regression.

Material Tab:

The user can open a material tab at any step of the analysis process. The first few steps, are equal to the 
calibration tab. The user uploads the data, detects the peaks using the analysis algorithms. Here, the user 
also needs to make an appropriate selection of the channels intended for use. It is important that the user 
selects the peaks such that they match the ones selected in the calibration trial. Following this step, the 
user can then select the material of the thin film. Afterwards, all that is left is to choose one, or more, 
calibration trials. The program will only use the energy from the radiation sources of the first calibration 
trial. This is why the the choice of peaks is of great importance. Finally, the user can calculate the 
thickness by clicking the button. The results will appear below the button, and in the final results tab.

XRA Tab:

The XRA Analysis Tab is independent of all other tab types and is specifically designed for film thickness 
determination. When using this tab, the first required step is to plot the Source Data, as the program will 
not allow the user to upload or plot any other data beforehand. Once the Source Data has been provided, the 
ser can then upload and plot the Source + Film Data, as well as optionally include Background Data. From 
the resulting plots, emission lines can be identified and subsequently used during the film thickness 
determination process. Unlike other analysis techniques within the program, the XRA Tab supports only a 
single method for peak analysis: the ROI (Region of Interest) Select Algorithm.

Other Features:

Besides the various analysis tools, ARC-TF also has a few other features that facilitate the process. 
The program has the option to delete the various instances of data, so the user can restart the analysis 
from a specific point. Likewise, the user can clear the entire data from a tab. The GUI has a settings menu, 
where the user can select the units to use. These vary for the units of the linear regression, which can be 
in keV or MeV, and for the units of thickness. These options can be applied to the entire program, or to a 
specific tab. This makes analysis for various thin films of different orders of magnitude possible. 
Furthermore, the user can create and delete tabs, add and remove material or radiation source files from 
the database. For the calibration trial, there is also the option for viewing an image detailing the the 
decay reaction of the selected radiation source. More images can be added or removed by the user. Besides 
these feature, there is also an About button, which will direct the user to the GitHub repository of the 
GUI.

Limitations:

ARC-TF is intended to be a simple and effective analysis tool, but naturally, a few limitations were considered. 
As of the publication of this article ARC-TF works only for Windows. The program only reads MCA domain files 
when the user uploads the file that has the experimental data. Furthermore, the program expects that the 
experimental values start only at line 13. In case of the files of the database, it will only read TXT domain 
files. In case of the materials database, the file must have the relative atomic mass in the first line, 
followed by "|" and then, the density plus another "|". For the remaining lines, the TXT file must be organized 
with the energy value followed by "|", the corresponding stopping power, and another "|".
In case of the radiation sources, the values need to be written in descending order of the values in MeV. The 
Graphic User Interface was designed to work for any given range of energies. However, the built-in database 
has the stopping powers corresponding to the energy range of 4 MeV to 8 MeV. This interval was chosen due 
to the energy of the radiation sources the NUC-RIA utilizes for their experiments. The incrementation of the 
range corresponds to 1 keV, as this is the lowest incrementation available in the ASTAR database from NIST. 
The program includes the stopping powers for the materials of Aluminium, Gold, Lead, PMMA and Tin. 
For the radiation sources of alpha particles, ARC-TF has the the values of Radium-226 and Uranium-232 in MeV.
In both the material and radiation sources, it is possible to add new files externally to ARC-TF's file folder, 
or internally.

The Algorithms

Threshold Input Algorithm:

This algorithm detects the various local channels with the highest counts. After uploading the experimental 
results from the detector, the user can input a threshold value. With this value, the program will only read 
the experimental results above this value, and ignore all the remainder. After the separation of the counts, 
the program will then detect the maximum of each curve. However this brings two problems: First, the algorithm 
will treat the low energy noise as a peak and consider certain channels as values of interest. Second, some 
of these curves will contain a few points that might fall below the threshold, probably due to systematic 
errors. For these problems the solution implemented was the same: Two variables that mitigate the effects. 
The first will make the algorithm only take into account values beyond a certain channel. This will solve 
the low energy noise points that would be detected. The variable is configured within the code with the 
value of Channel = 100. As for the other variable, if the algorithm registers two points whose channels 
differ only by a value of a certain amount, Channel(k+1) - Channel(k) < 35, it will only keep the one 
with most counts. Both of these values can be altered in the Settings Menu of the program, and their 
function is to keep the algorithm more exact, in order to minimize the intervention of the user.
After the peaks are detected, the program stores the Counts and the Channels of the points in a temporary 
file.

Manual Selection Algorithm:

This algorithm, like the one before it, detects the various points. However, unlike the Threshold Input, 
there is no input value from the user and it does not necessarily detect local maximums. Instead, the user 
can simply right click with his mouse on the graphic, to detect the nearest points. This means that the user 
has freedom to select the maximum values, but also other points. The algorithm is simple, only using a least 
square difference to check which points to save in a temporary file. The algorithm then configures any point 
to a temporary file, treating it as a local maximum. It is a semi-automatic algorithm that can be used in 
junction with the Threshold Input Algorithm interchangeably. The exactness of the values depends only on 
where the user clicks.

The Linear Regression Algorithm:

This algorithm performs a simple linear regression. It is included in the article simply to showcase the 
nature of the linear regression method, and how the uncertainty of the parameters are calculated. It starts 
by sorting the results of the channels detected by the previous two algorithms and the values of decay energy 
of the radiation source. This does not create any error for the linear regression since the values have an 
ascending order. In fact, since the user can acquire the channels of the spectrum in any order, it is an 
imperative step to perform. Here the y values are the decay energies of the alpha particles and the x values 
are the channels detected. Because there is no method in the program that calculates the uncertainty of the 
channels from the experimental results, the uncertainty of the slope and intersect are acquired by the
traditional error formulas with no propagation of uncertainty. The procedure for calculating the uncertainty, 
until a method to obtain the uncertainty of the experimental data itself is implemented, remains in a 
generalized form. This has the consequence of a larger uncertainty, but suffices for preliminary results, 
and an initial version of ARC-TF.

The Thickness Approximation Algorithm:

The final calculation receives data from the previous algorithms and condenses it for the sum of inverse 
stopping powers. The algorithm needs to apply the calibration, using the linear regression results, to 
the channels of the spectrum with a thin film. Due to the nature of the experimental setup of the Alpha 
Energy Loss, it is necessary to change the vacuum chamber. This might uncalibrate the setup. For precaution, 
new calibration runs are performed. Should the linear regression deviate significantly from the original 
calibration, it indicates that the experimental data might not be exact. However, if the deviation is
neglectable, the user has the option to select both linear regressions from the different trials. For the 
algorithm, this is possible for any number of calibration trials the user wishes to select. The algorithm 
averages all the linear regression values, and applies the final results to the channels detected by the 
first two algorithms on the spectrum of the thin film. The next step consists on finding the stopping power 
range, that will be used in the aforementioned equation. For this, the program checks the decay energies 
used of the first calibration trial the user has selected for the linear regressions. It will only consider 
the energy values of this calibration trial. These values become the final energy, while the channels, 
after the linear regression is applied to them, become the initial energy. With this range, the equation 
is computed, and with the internal database of a few materials, an approximate thickness is calculated. 
This is done for every channel corresponding to a peak. After this step, an average of the thickness is 
obtained, while its uncertainty is computed using standard deviation over the square root of the number 
of peaks minus one. The results are then presented in the selected units.

ROI Select Algorithm:

The ROI Select Algorithm is applied across three different tabs of the application: Calibration, Material,
and XRA. Each of these tabs makes use of the algorithm in slightly different ways, depending on the type
of analysis being performed.
In the Calibration and Material tabs, users can select up to six regions of interest. For each selected 
ROI, the algorithm calculates three key parameters: the centroid, the sigma, and the error associated with 
the peak. These values are determined using traditional methods, which directly analyze the data within the 
chosen regions. As a result, the user can extract up to six sets of centroid, sigma, and error values 
corresponding to the selected peaks.
The XRA tab, by contrast, allows for the selection of only one ROI, reflecting the different requirements 
of its functionality. In this tab, a Gaussian fit is applied to the selected emission line. From this fit, 
the algorithm derives the centroid, sigma, and the area under the curve. The fitting process is carried 
out for Source, Source + Film, and if available for Background data. The calculated area represents the 
integrated area under the Gaussian curve, within the ROI, and corresponds to the intensity of the selected emission line.



The Thickness Calculation Algorithm for XRA:
After peak analysis for the XRA tab, the user has two options for choosing the linear attenuation coefficient: 
Default and User.
When the Default option is selected, the user must specify the film material and the source that were used during 
the experiment. These values are then retrieved from the database, and the program automatically applies the 
corresponding parameter for the thickness calculation.
When the User option is selected, the user directly needs to enter the linear attenuation coefficient of the material. 
This option is particularly useful when the film material used in the experiment is not included in the default database.
In both cases, once the Run button is clicked, the interface calculates and displays the film thickness together with 
the associated uncertainty.
